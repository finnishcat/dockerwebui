## 🔒 Security Highlights

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with 30-minute expiration
- Configurable secret keys via environment variables
- All Docker API endpoints require authentication
- WebSocket connections require valid JWT

### Input Validation
- Container IDs: Alphanumeric, 12-64 characters
- Image names: Valid Docker image format
- Node names: Alphanumeric with underscore, max 32 chars
- Usernames: 3-32 chars, alphanumeric with underscore/hyphen
- Passwords: Minimum 8 characters

### Network Security
- CORS configured with environment-based origins
- Trusted host middleware available
- Security headers recommended for production
- WebSocket authentication required

### Data Security
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (never stored in plain text)
- JWT tokens signed and verified
- User data persisted in JSON file (secure in Docker volume)
